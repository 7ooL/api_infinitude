# pyInfinitude
python API to interact with Infinitude

# works with https://github.com/nebulous/infinitude
Infinitude is an alternative web service for Carrier Infinity Touch and compatible thermostats.

# purpose
I'm writing my own home automation program and tieing in the HVAC system is just one part. I wasn't able to do all that i wanted using the current Infinitude API. This class will have a get and set function for each value in the infinitude system configuation file.
